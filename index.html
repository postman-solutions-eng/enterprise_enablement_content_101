					<p>
						You're likely exploring this course if you're new to Postman or the API space, in general.
					</p>
					<p>Let's start by sharing a little about your needs from this course.</p>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#introSlides">"I want to understand what an API is and how Postman involves APIs"</a></li>
						<li><a href="#firstRequestAndTestSlides">“I need to see if my API does what I expect it to do."</a></li>

						<h2>What is an API?</h2><br>
						<p>“API” stands for Application Programming Interface. It enables software to communicate with other software.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>A client (the patron, or application, at the restaurant)</li>
							<li>A waiter (the API, or middle service, at the restaurant)</li>
							<li>A chef (the server that assembles data, or ingredients, and intimately knows the data structures of the database)</li>
						</ul><br>
						<p>In this example, the API offered up a menu to the client from which the client could choose what to consume.</p>

						<h2>How does Postman interact with APIs?</h2>
						<p>Postman is a collaborative platform for building, using, and testing APIs. 
							<!-- insert statement about different types of users: beginners to development, QA engineers, software engineers, technical support, etc… to illustrate accessibility across a variety of roles -->
							<!-- insert giphy of sending a request and reading a response in postman -->

						<p>Another tool often used by developers to interact with APIs is CURL. CURL is...</p>
