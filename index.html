						<h3>What is an API?</h3><br>
						<p>“API” stands for Application Programming Interface. APIs enables software to communicate with other software and they are the foundation of modern software development.</p>

						<p>Sometimes trickier concepts are more easily understood through analogies, so let’s imagine a digital restaurant in which there are three characters.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/apiRestaurant.png">
					</section>
					<section>
						<code>A client</code> - the patron, or application, at the restaurant<br></br>
						<code>A waiter</code> - the API, or middle service, at the restaurant<br></br>
						<code>A chef</code> - the server that assembles data, or ingredients, and intimately knows the data structures of the database
						<br></br>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>In this example, the API offered up a menu to the client from which the client could choose what to consume. Watch Claire Froelich expand more on this example in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKReG34IgAM">video.</a></p>

					<section id="postmanAndAPIs">
						<h2>How does Postman interact with APIs?</h2>
						<p>Postman is a collaborative platform for building, using, and testing APIs. It uses HTTP, or hypertext transfer protocol, to transmit data in a request-response cycle.
						</p>
						<p> More than 10 million people use Postman and for many teams, Postman is an everyday tool used to interact with APIs.</p>
					</section>
					<section id="otherTools">
						<h3>Other Tools and Competitive Differentiators</h3>
						<p>Another tool often used by developers to interact with APIs is cURL. cURL, which stands for client URL, is a command line tool that developers use to transfer data to and from a server. Sound familiar?</p>
						<img src="images/curl.gif" alt="gif of curl command usage"/>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Not all developers can work easily with walls of text and many prefer the graphical user interface Postman offers.</p>

						<h3>Request-Response Cycle</h3>
						<p>Debugging an API involves understanding the anatomy of a request and response from an API.</p>
						<img src="images/debugbootcamp.gif"/>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Whenever we are transmitting data (whether information is coming FROM or going TO a database), we are interacting with an API in a <strong>request-response cycle.</strong></p>
						<p>Some things we would find in a request are a Method and an Endpoint with a Path.</p>
						<img src="images/anatomeRequest.png"/>
						<p>A request can also include Parameters, Headers, and a Body.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>When testing an API, it's especially important to understand the anatomy of a response from the API.</p>
						<p>Developers pay close attention to status codes, headers, and response bodies that APIs return.</p>
						<img src="images/inspectResponse.gif"/>
					</section>
					<section id="tests">
						<h3>Writing Tests</h3>
						<p>Postman allows developers to write their own <strong>tests</strong>, which can <strong>analyze response data</strong> in order to ensure the expected information was retrieved or sent.</p>
						<p>For more practice testing APIs, watch Valentin Despa walk through the anatomy of a response and writing tests in this <a href="https://youtu.be/VywxIQ2ZXw4?t=3775">video.</a></p>

						<p>There are many different ways to collaborate within Postman. To begin, let's review some key concepts about workspaces.</p>
						<img src="images/workspaceIntro.gif"/>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Workspaces allow users to <strong>group</strong> related APIs, collections, environments, mocks, and monitors. There are four categories of workspaces.</p> <br>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<strong>Public</strong> - These workspaces enable collaboration on entities with anyone across the world.<a href="https://youtu.be/LYDtomysuBw">More info in this video.</a>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Team</strong> - These workspaces enable access to be shared and managed with select collaborators. <a href="https://youtu.be/5lscUV-Exac">More info in this video.</a>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Personal</strong> - These workspaces are visible only to you.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Private</strong> - Business and Enterprise users can limit visibility of this workspace to invited members.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section id="roles">
						<h3>Roles in Postman</h3>
						<p>Workspace admins can modify the admin and collaborator roles for the workspace. Editors of particular elements can modify the editor and viewer role on the element.</p>
						<p>With these roles, you and your teammates can manage access for each individual, or, if you are on a Postman Enterprise plan, for groups.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						As an admin, you can manage roles by navigating to <br> <code>Team > Manage Team > Manage Roles</code> <img src="images/manageteam.png"> <br> <img src="images/manageRoles.png">
					</section>
					<section id="sharing">
						<h3>Sharing to Workspaces</h3>
						<p>To share an API, collection, or environment, navigate to the left-most side of Postman to select the entity you wish to share. Then, from the dropdown in the "<code>...</code>" menu, select <code><strong>Share __</strong></code>.</p>
						<p>In the share modal, select the workspace you want to share the entity to. Team members in the target workspace will be able to access the entity when you share it there.</p>
						<img src="images/selectShare.png">      <img src="images/shareToWS.png">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Other Ways to Share</h3>
						<p>In addition to sharing to workspaces, entities can be shared via embedding or public json link. </p>
						<img src="images/shareViaLink.png">
					</section>
					<section id="commenting">
						<h3> Commenting</h3>
						<p>Commenting allows teams to collaborate live while working on APIs in Postman. There are several ways to comment on various components within collections. Find more information about commenting in <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/commenting-on-collections/">this documentation.</a></p>
						<img src="images/commenting-on-a-collection-v8.gif">
					</section>
					<section id="apiNetwork">
						<h3>API Network</h3>
						<img src="images/publicNetwork.gif">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The API network is a centralized repository of APIs, Collections, and Workspaces. It can be found by visiting <a href="https://explore.postman.com">explore.postman.com</a></p>
						<p>You can use the API network to browse what others in the greater API community are building.</p>
					</section>
					<section id="versionControl">
						<h3>Version Control</h3>
						<p>There are a variety of utilities available within Postman to enable users to version control <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/version-control-for-collections/">collections</a> and <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/">APIs.</a></p>
						<p>We can logically divide these utilities into three functions:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Change-Management</li>
							<li>Change-Notification</li>
							<li>Change-Recording</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Change-Management</h4>
						<p>Our change-management utilities allow users to <strong>fork, merge,</strong> see <strong>differences,</strong> and submit <strong>pull requests</strong>. Developer teams use these processes to work together on the same projects.</p>
						<p>Check out Joyce walking through these steps <a href="https://youtu.be/QKxukXJWRPI">here.</a></p>
						<img src="images/create-a-fork-v2.jpeg">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Change-Notification</h4>
						<p>The <strong>watch</strong> option allows you to receive an email/in-app notification when one of your team member belonging to the same workspace modifies the collection. If you watch a collection, you will be notified of actions such as adding a new request, modifying the existing requests, adding or updating variables, editing pre-request scripts or tests, adding or deleting a folder and so on </p>
						<p>Find more information about change notifications <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/version-control-for-collections/#watching-a-collection">here.</a></p>
						<img src="images/collection-watching-overview-v8.jpeg">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Change-Recording</h4>
						<p>Changes are recorded in the Postman <strong>changelog.</strong></p>
						<img src="images/changelog.png">
